## Introduction

Welcome to the SWI-Prolog Learning Repository! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive learning resource for anyone interested in mastering SWI-Prolog, a popular logic programming language used for solving complex problems involving knowledge representation and reasoning. Through this collection of examples, exercises, and projects, you will gain hands-on experience and improve your understanding of Prolog's fundamental concepts and advanced features.

## Getting Started

To get started with SWI-Prolog, clone this repository and follow the installation instructions below.

## Folder Structure

- **examples/**: Basic Prolog examples to get you started.
- **exercises/**: Practice problems to test your knowledge.
- **projects/**: Mini-projects to apply what youâ€™ve learned.

## Installation

1. **Install SWI-Prolog**: Download and install SWI-Prolog from [SWI-Prolog.org](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html).
2. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swi-prolog-learning.git
    cd swi-prolog-learning
    ```

## Basic Commands

- Run a Prolog file: `swipl -f filename.pl`
- Load a Prolog file within the SWI-Prolog shell: `?- [filename].`
- Consult a file: `?- consult('filename.pl').`

## Screenshots
